    "\n",
    "## a) Which one of these Bayesian networks are correct representations of the preceding information?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each telescope has an independent Fi. N and Fi are inputs for the telescope and Mi is the output. The telescope's N and Fi also influence our Mi. N conditionally depends on Fi and Mi. P(N|Mi, Fi) cannot be simplified to P(N|Mi) so graph (i) does not accurately represent the information. However graphs (ii) and (iii) are correct representations of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## b) Which is the best network?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Network (ii) is the best network because it has a fewer number of edges and thus will have fewer values to work with during calculations. Overall it is a much more efficient implementation than network (iii).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## c) Write out a conditional distribution for p(M1|N), where N is in {1,2,3} and M1 is in {0,1,2,3,4}. Each entry of the conditional distribution should be expressed as a function of the parameters _e_ and *f*. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    The following set of pairs (N, Mi) have a value of 0\n",
    "    {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1)}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The follwing set of pairs have a value of f\n",
    "    {(2, 0), (3, 0)}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The following set of pairs have a value of (1-e)(1-f)\n",
    "    {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The following set of pairs have a value of e(1-f)/2\n",
    "    {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The pair (1,0) has a value of e(1-f)/2 + f\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## d) Suppose M1 = 1 and M2 = 3. What are the possible number of stars if we assume no prior constraints on the value of N?\n",
    "\n",
    "    With no prior constraints on the value of N and these values for Mi, the possible number of stars that we could potentially observe is 2, 4, and any value 6 or greater.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## e) What is the most likely number of stars given these observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since we know that N can only be of values 2, 4 and 6+, we just need to evaluate these values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The probability that each telescope under or over counted the starts when N = 2 is\n",
    "    e^2 * (1-f)^2 / 4\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The probability when N = 4 is\n",
    "    e * (1-f) * f / 4\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The probability when N = 6 is\n",
    "    f^2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Becuase e is always greater than f, we can assume that e*(1-f)/4 > f. Therefore the probability for N=2 is greater than that for N in {4, 6, ...}\n",

    "## a) Can knowledge of the value of projector_plugged_in affect your belief in the value of Sam_reading_book?\n",
    "\n",
    "    No, the value of projector_plugged_in does not affect belief in the value of sam_reading_book. Power_in_wire will check the dependency flow from projector_plugged_in to sam_reading_book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## b) Can knowledge of screen_lit_up affect your belief in Sam_reading_book?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes, the knowledge of screen_lit_up does affect belief in the value of sam_reading_book. The path from screen_lit_up to sam_reading_book is not checked by any value, so they are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## c) Can knowledge of the value of projector_plugged_in affect your belief in the value of Sam_reading_book given that you have observed a value for a screen_lit_up?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes, knowledge of the value projector_plugged_in given that I have observed a value for screen_lit_up does affect belief in the value of sam_reading_book. Our path from (b) necessitates checks for dependency because power_in_wire exists within that path. This means that power_in_wire will not be checking the dependency flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## d) Which variables could have their probabilities changed if just lamp_works was observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The variables projector_lamp_on, screen_lit_up, and ray_says_\"screen_is_dark\" will have their probabilities changed if just lamp_works is observed. The path from these variables to lamp_words has no variables that check for dependency flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## e) Which variables could have their probabilities changed if just power_in_projector was observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Only input variables light_switch_on, ray_is_awake, lamp_works, and  mirror_working are NOT affected by observing power_in_projector. This is because the path from power_in_projector to every other variable has some variable that checks dependency flows."
